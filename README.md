# TO-DO-LIST
This project is a command-line To-Do List that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks. Task data is stored in a JSON file for persistence. The project helps build skills in list management, file handling, and menu-driven programming using Python.
